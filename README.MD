# Staged multi-omics data classification using uncertainty quantification

This study aims to perform multi-omics data classification, starting with one omics data and add the additional data when necessary.

When using one and two omics data, the DST theory was employed to determine the classification probability and the uncertaitny. After training the model, an algorithm was implementated to determine the threshold to accept the model prediction or reject and add another modality.
